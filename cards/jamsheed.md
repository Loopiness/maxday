# Happy birthday!!

Already sent you a message on Slack, but it won't hurt to send one here :) Thanks for being a selfless, amazing, caring human being and changing the world. You're a super kind person and you've really sacrificed a lot to get Hack Club up and running as well as spread your passion for programming to other people who really need it. I look up to you and I respect youâ€”thanks so much for all you do, and most importantly, enjoy your day and the year to come. Cheers!
